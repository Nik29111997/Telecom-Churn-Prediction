# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## üìù Overview

In the telecom industry, customers frequently switch operators if not offered attractive schemes. Preventing existing customers from churning is critical. As a data scientist, your task is to build an ML model to predict if a customer will churn in a particular month, based on historical data.

## üìå Problem Statement

- Customers can choose from multiple service providers and often switch.
- The industry faces a 15‚Äì25% annual churn rate.
- Retaining a customer is 5‚Äì10√ó cheaper than acquiring a new one.
- The business goal: **Predict which customers are at high risk of churn** using customer-level data and ML models.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Predict Customer Churn:** Build a model that can accurately predict which customers are at risk of leaving the company[2][5][6].
- **Understand Customer Behavior:** Analyze patterns in customer data to identify why customers might leave[2][5][6].
- **Support Business Decisions:** Provide clear, actionable insights and recommendations to help the business reduce churn and improve customer retention[2][5][6].

## üèÜ Achievements

- **Developed Accurate Prediction Models:** Built and tested several machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) to predict customer churn with high accuracy[2][6].
- **Identified Key Risk Factors:** Discovered which customer behaviors and attributes are most linked to churn, helping the company understand what drives customers to leave[2][5][6].
- **Actionable Insights:** Provided easy-to-understand recommendations for business teams to improve customer retention, such as targeting at-risk customers with special offers[2][5].
- **Improved Data Understanding:** Cleaned and analyzed large datasets to extract meaningful trends and patterns, making complex data accessible for non-technical stakeholders[2][6].
- **Business Impact:** Enabled the company to take proactive steps to keep valuable customers, leading to potential savings and increased customer loyalty[2][6].
